# Remix Live Environment

Remix is a flexible programming language based around the idea of mix-fix (as opposed to post-fix) function names, with as many space separated words and parameters as you want. This means that there is a very straightforward path from designing a program in natural language pseudocode and transitioning it to running Remix code.

This repository contains a live environment built in Red, the language Remix is built from. This allows edits to be shown in real-time, allowing an understanding of the code to be better conveyed.
